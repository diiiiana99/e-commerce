## How to Run This Application:
* Setting up your enviroment


Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, Xcode, and CocoaPods are all required.


While you may develop your app with whichever editor you choose, you'll need to install Xcode to get the required tooling to build a React Native app for iOS.Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

```
brew install node
brew install watchman
```


Watchman is a Facebook tool that monitors filesystem modifications. It is strongly advised that you install it for improved performance.


* Xcode
The Mac App Store is the most convenient method to get Xcode. When you install Xcode, you'll also get the iOS Simulator and all of the tools you'll need to create an iOS app.


* Installing an iOS Simulator in Xcode
To install a simulator, open Xcode > Preferences... and select the Components tab. Select a simulator with the corresponding version of iOS you wish to use.



* CocoaPods is written in Ruby and may be installed using the standard Ruby on macOS. You can use a Ruby Version Manager, but until you're sure what you're doing, we recommend sticking with the regular Ruby on macOS.When installing gems with the usual Ruby installation, you'll need to use sudo. (However, this is only a problem for the time of the gem installation.)

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```


* Once you have set up your enviroment and installed dependencies. Follow the next steps:

Step 1: Once you fork and clone into your enviroment. Open up your Xcode and press play button too build the project and run the stimulator. To start Metro, run npx react-native start inside your React Native project folder:

```
npx react-native start
```


Step 2: Start your application
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal inside your React Native project folder. Run the following:

```
npx react-native run-ios
```


Step 3: You may need to run the app on your device to experience all the features. In order to do so you need to: 

* Connect your gadget to your computer via USB.
Using a USB to Lightning connector, connect your iOS device to your Mac. Navigate to your project's ios folder, then open the.xcodeproj file (or.xcworkspace if you're using CocoaPods) within it using Xcode.


If this is the first time you've used your iOS device to launch an app, you may need to register it for development. From the Xcode menubar, choose Product, then Destination. Look for your device in the list and pick it. The device will then be registered for development by Xcode.

* Set up code signing
If you don't already have one, sign up for an Apple developer account.


In the Xcode Project Navigator, choose the project, then your primary target (it should share the same name as your project). Look for the "General" tab on the left-hand side of the screen. Make sure your Apple developer account or team is chosen in the Team selection under "Signing." Carry out the same procedure for the test's goal (it ends with Tests, and is below your main target).


* Create and launch your app
If everything is set up successfully, your device will appear in the Xcode toolbar as a build target, as well as in the Devices pane (2). You may now pick Run from the Product menu or hit the Build and run button (R). Your app will be available on your device in a few moments.
